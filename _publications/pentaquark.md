We investigate the mass spectra of exotic hadrons known as pentaquarks. We extend a simple phenomenological model based on the GÃ¼rsey-Radicati mass formula for hadrons to include both charmed and bottom baryons as well as to be able to predict masses of pentaquark states including both charm and bottom quark-antiquark pairs. In particular, we perform numerical fits of this model, which includes seven free parameters, to masses of 21 baryons. We find that the model can be well fitted to the experimental values of the baryon masses and observe that the predicted value of about 4400 MeV for the mass of the pentaquark \\(P_c(4380)^+\\) lies within the experimental range reported by the LHCb experiment. In addition, the predicted value of about 4500 MeV for the mass of the pentaquark \\(P_c(4450)^+\\) is close to the experimental value. Finally, in the future, other predicted values for masses of additional pentaquarks could be shown to agree with upcoming experimental results.
