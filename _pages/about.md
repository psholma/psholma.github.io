Currently starting a new position pursuing a PhD at Stockholm University, where I will be working in the physics department with a research focus on application of machine learning and novel statistical methods to problems in cosmology, specifically investigating approaches to Bayesian inference frameworks to better understand the initial conditions of the Universe. This will be a continuation of my previous work in the field performed during a master thesis in 2024, of which a short description is found in the [research](/research/) tab. The full thesis is found in the [university archive](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1873671).

Previously a MSc student in Engineering Physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where I specialized in theoretical physics. I enjoy all things physics, mathematics, machine learning and computer science, as well as the occasional finance deepdive. During my former studies I have been given the opportunity to gain experience in [teaching](/teaching/) at a university level and find aiding students on both their academic and personal journeys very rewarding, as well as fulfilling. Everyone can learn something from one another, regardless of the difference in experience level.




Miscellaneous Physics Projects
------
During my bachelor thesis I investigated an exotic type of hadrons known as pentaquarks, which resulted in a publication that can be found in the [publication](/publications) tab above.

In a seminar course I also wrote a short review article on the topic of loop quantum gravity, which can be found in the following [link](/files/QG_Report.pdf).

Other Academic Interests
------
I have additional interest in topics related to computing and computer science, specifically High-Performance Computing, GPU programming as well as computer architecture in general. Eventually there will be some blog posts related to these topics as well. It'll get done tomorrow...surely?
