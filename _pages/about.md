PhD student in cosmology at Stockholm University starting in June 2025 with a research focus on the application of machine learning to problems in cosmology, specifically investigating approaches to Bayesian inference frameworks to better understand the initial conditions of the Universe. A short description of my previous research is found in the [research](/research/) tab, with my full MSc thesis on the topic is found in this [university archive](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1873671).

Previously a MSc student with specialization in theoretical physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. During my former studies I have been very involved in [teaching](/teaching/) at KTH and find aiding students on their academic and personal journeys very rewarding, as well as fulfilling. Everyone can learn something from one another, regardless of experience level.

Currently starting a new position pursuing a PhD at Stockholm University, where I will be working in the physics department with a research focus on the application of machine learning and novel statistical methods to problems in cosmology, specifically investigating approaches to Bayesian inference frameworks to better understand the initial conditions of the Universe. This will be a continuation of my previous work in the field performed during a master thesis in 2024, of which a short description is found in the [research](/research/) tab. The full thesis is found in this [university archive](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1873671).

Previously a MSc student in Engineering Physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where I specialized in theoretical physics. I enjoy all things physics, mathematics and machine learning, as well as the occasional finance deepdive. During my former studies I have been given the opportunity to gain experience in [teaching](/teaching/) at a university level and find aiding students on both their academic and personal journeys very rewarding, as well as fulfilling. Everyone can learn something from one another, regardless of the difference in experience level.

Miscellaneous Physics Projects
------
During my BSc thesis I investigated an exotic type of hadrons known as pentaquarks, which resulted in a publication that can be found in the [publication](/publications) tab above.

For a seminar course I wrote a review article on the topic of quantum gravity, which can be found in following [link](/files/QG_Report.pdf). 
<!--which can be found in the following [link](/files/QG_Report.pdf). -->

Other Interests
------
I have additional newfound interest in topics related to computing, specifically HPC, GPUs, as well as computer architecture in general. Eventually there will be some blog posts related to these topics as well. It'll get done tomorrow...surely?

Below is a photo of me in a Hawaiian shirt lifting a 1000kg tree. Yes, really. Don't you see the Hawaiian shirt?
